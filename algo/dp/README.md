DP - Storing values from overlapping subproblems so that it's not recomputed. Essentially a trade-off between space and time. Use more space to decrease the total time taken. 

3 steps to solve a problem using DP.

1. Recursive solution 
2. Memoize the recursive solution.
3. Bottom up approach. 

A simple example of using DP to improve the efficiency can be used to find Fibanocci numbers.
